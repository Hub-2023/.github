The **Take2 Curriculum** balances the learning of a computer language with the hands-on project-based learning that builds confidence through the construction of personalised working applications.

We teach simple Website elements first, then the core features of any programming language in JavaScript. Early in the course, we move the learning environment to a Web Framework (React) in order to put our students into a place where they are more readily productive in a commercial setting.

The Take2 Curriculum sets out to teach Full Stack programming via three major milestones:
1. Basic JavaScript language and a first working React Application
2. Working front end that manages state, functionally process data, stores data in the browser, and consumes from an external API
3. Full Stack implementation using MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS)



Here you will find the challenges and exercises to acompany you on this learning journey.
